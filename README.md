üìä Cardiovascular Health Data Analysis and Preprocessing

This project presents a complete workflow for exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and data preprocessing on a cardiovascular health dataset. The pipeline includes cleaning, descriptive statistics, visualization, discretization, normalization, and export of results for reporting and downstream modeling.

üéØ Objectives
	‚Ä¢	Clean and transform raw data into an analysis-ready format.
	‚Ä¢	Summarize and visualize key distributions and relationships.
	‚Ä¢	Engineer new features through discretization and normalization.
	‚Ä¢	Generate clear reports and visual artifacts to support interpretation.

‚∏ª

üü¢ Workflow Overview

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Import and Preparation
	‚Ä¢	Loaded the dataset (CSV) into a pandas DataFrame.
	‚Ä¢	Converted age from days to integer years (age_years).
	‚Ä¢	Recoded binary categorical features (smoke, alco, active, cardio) to 0/1 indicators.

‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£ Descriptive Statistics & Univariate Analysis
	‚Ä¢	Computed summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, quartiles) for continuous variables and saved to Excel.
	‚Ä¢	Generated and exported:
	‚Ä¢	Histograms with KDE curves to illustrate distributions.
	‚Ä¢	Boxplots to identify outliers.
	‚Ä¢	Bar charts to show category frequencies for categorical variables.

‚∏ª

3Ô∏è‚É£ Multivariate Exploration
	‚Ä¢	Calculated a correlation matrix and visualized it with a heatmap to assess linear relationships.
	‚Ä¢	Created a pairplot to explore variable interactions and potential clusters by the cardio target.

‚∏ª

4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering
	‚Ä¢	Height Binning:
	‚Ä¢	Equi-width binning: Divided height into 5 intervals of equal range.
	‚Ä¢	Equi-depth binning: Created 5 quantile-based bins.
	‚Ä¢	Results saved to Excel for comparison.
	‚Ä¢	Weight Normalization:
	‚Ä¢	Min-Max scaling: Rescaled weight to the [0, 1] range.
	‚Ä¢	Z-score standardization: Standardized weight to have mean 0 and unit variance.
	‚Ä¢	Normalized data exported to Excel.
	‚Ä¢	Age Discretization:
	‚Ä¢	Grouped age_years into 5 meaningful age categories:
	‚Ä¢	Young
	‚Ä¢	Early Adulthood
	‚Ä¢	Early Middle Age
	‚Ä¢	Late Middle Age
	‚Ä¢	Late Adulthood
	‚Ä¢	Computed and saved frequency counts of each group.
	‚Ä¢	Smoke Binarization:
	‚Ä¢	Verified and exported binary encoding of smoking status.

üìÇ Generated Outputs
	‚Ä¢	Excel Reports:
	‚Ä¢	1A_summary_stats.xlsx: Descriptive statistics of continuous features.
	‚Ä¢	fda_a2_25528908.xlsx: Contains:
	‚Ä¢	Height binning results (equi-width and equi-depth)
	‚Ä¢	Weight normalization outputs
	‚Ä¢	Age discretization and frequency table
	‚Ä¢	Smoke binarization results
	‚Ä¢	Visualizations (PNG):
	‚Ä¢	Histograms of continuous variables
	‚Ä¢	Boxplots highlighting outliers
	‚Ä¢	Bar charts of categorical distributions
	‚Ä¢	Correlation heatmap
	‚Ä¢	Pairplot of selected variables colored by cardio status

‚öôÔ∏è Reproducibility

To reproduce the analysis:
	1.	Install dependencies:
      pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn openpyxl

  2.	Place the CSV dataset in your working directory.
	3.	Run the script to automatically generate all outputs.
