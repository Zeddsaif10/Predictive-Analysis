# Predictive-Analysis

üìä Cardiovascular Health Data Exploration and Preprocessing

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing of a cardiovascular health dataset to understand variable distributions, relationships, and prepare data transformations suitable for further modeling or statistical analysis.

üìù Key Objectives
	‚Ä¢	Clean and preprocess raw health data.
	‚Ä¢	Generate descriptive statistics and visualizations to summarize distributions and detect outliers.
	‚Ä¢	Explore multivariate correlations and patterns.
	‚Ä¢	Apply data transformation techniques, including binning, normalization, and discretization.

üõ†Ô∏è Data Processing and Analysis Steps

1. Data Cleaning
	‚Ä¢	Converted age from days to years (age_years).
	‚Ä¢	Binarized categorical Yes/No columns (smoke, alco, active, cardio) to numerical values (1/0).

‚∏ª

2. Descriptive Statistics and Visualization
	‚Ä¢	Summary Statistics:
	‚Ä¢	Computed count, mean, standard deviation, quartiles, and range for continuous variables:
	‚Ä¢	age_years, height, weight, ap_hi, ap_lo
	‚Ä¢	Exported statistics to Excel for documentation.
	‚Ä¢	Univariate Visualizations:
	‚Ä¢	Histograms and Kernel Density Estimates (KDE) for continuous variables.
	‚Ä¢	Boxplots to visualize distributions and identify outliers.
	‚Ä¢	Bar charts for categorical variable frequencies:
	‚Ä¢	gender, cholesterol, gluc, smoke, alco, active, cardio

3. Multivariate Analysis
	‚Ä¢	Correlation Analysis:
	‚Ä¢	Computed Pearson correlation matrix across numeric and binary attributes.
	‚Ä¢	Generated a heatmap to highlight relationships (e.g., age vs. blood pressure, weight vs. cholesterol).
	‚Ä¢	Pairwise Relationships:
	‚Ä¢	Developed a pairplot (scatterplot matrix) stratified by the cardio outcome variable to explore clustering and separation patterns.

4. Feature Engineering and Transformation
	‚Ä¢	Height Binning:
	‚Ä¢	Created two types of height bins:
	‚Ä¢	Equal-width binning (5 intervals of fixed range)
	‚Ä¢	Equal-depth (quantile) binning (5 bins with balanced record counts)
	‚Ä¢	Weight Normalization:
	‚Ä¢	Applied:
	‚Ä¢	Min-Max Scaling (range 0‚Äì1)
	‚Ä¢	Z-score Standardization (mean 0, variance 1)
	‚Ä¢	Age Discretization:
	‚Ä¢	Classified age into 5 life stages:
	‚Ä¢	Young
	‚Ä¢	Early Adulthood
	‚Ä¢	Early Middle Age
	‚Ä¢	Late Middle Age
	‚Ä¢	Late Adulthood
	‚Ä¢	Tabulated and exported frequency counts per age group.
	‚Ä¢	Smoke Binarization:
	‚Ä¢	Verified correct encoding of smoking status into binary format.

üíæ Outputs

All processed data, summaries, and transformation results are saved as:
	‚Ä¢	Individual Excel sheets (fda_a2_25528908.xlsx)
	‚Ä¢	Visual plots (.png files) for histograms, boxplots, bar charts, heatmaps, and pairplots.

üîß Technologies and Libraries
	‚Ä¢	Python 3
	‚Ä¢	Pandas: data manipulation and cleaning
	‚Ä¢	Seaborn & Matplotlib: visualization
	‚Ä¢	Scikit-learn: normalization and scaling
	‚Ä¢	OpenPyXL: Excel export

‚úÖ Usage

This workflow serves as a template for:
	‚Ä¢	Preliminary EDA of health-related datasets.
	‚Ä¢	Preprocessing pipelines before machine learning.
	‚Ä¢	Reporting and visualization of demographic and clinical indicators.
