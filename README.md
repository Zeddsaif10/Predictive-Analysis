# üìä Cardiovascular Health Data Exploration and Preprocessing

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing of a cardiovascular health dataset to understand variable distributions, relationships, and prepare data transformations suitable for further modeling or statistical analysis.

---

## üìù Key Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw health data.
- Generate descriptive statistics and visualizations to summarize distributions and detect outliers.
- Explore multivariate correlations and patterns.
- Apply data transformation techniques, including binning, normalization, and discretization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Processing and Analysis Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning
- Converted **age** from days to years (`age_years`).
- Binarized categorical `Yes/No` columns (`smoke`, `alco`, `active`, `cardio`) to numeric format (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Descriptive Statistics and Visualization
- **Summary Statistics:**
  - Computed count, mean, standard deviation, quartiles, and ranges for continuous variables.
  - Exported results to Excel (`1A_summary_stats.xlsx`).
- **Univariate Visualizations:**
  - Histograms with KDE overlays for distributions.
  - Boxplots for identifying outliers.
  - Bar charts to display frequencies of categorical variables.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Multivariate Analysis
- **Correlation Matrix:**
  - Pearson correlations among numeric and binary variables.
  - Heatmap visualization.
- **Pairwise Relationships:**
  - Pairplot stratified by `cardio` outcome to observe clusters and potential predictors.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering and Transformation
- **Height Binning:**
  - Equal-width and equal-depth binning into 5 groups.
- **Weight Normalization:**
  - Min-Max scaling (0‚Äì1 range).
  - Z-score standardization (mean 0, SD 1).
- **Age Discretization:**
  - Categorized into 5 life stages:
    - Young
    - Early Adulthood
    - Early Middle Age
    - Late Middle Age
    - Late Adulthood
- **Smoke Binarization:**
  - Validated binary encoding.
